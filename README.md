# Gym-Management-System

With the help of this project, a user can easily track different activities from a single panel. This web-based management system will allow the user to track their membership duration, connect with their trainers, view/check the standardization, renewal of their membership, issuance of their timetable, or raise any query. On the other end, the admin will have the right to add/delete any member, approve/reject any request, etc. This is great and very straightforward for managing fitness centers in a parallel platform using PHP. Besides this, this project will provide:

Easy to manage, maintain, and eliminates all paperwork
Admin can add any upcoming announcements or add any modifications as per need
Easy to track payment history and send reminders to their users
